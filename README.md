A sandbox for me to play around with DDD tactical techniques while implementing the common coding challenge of Vending Machine.

# The task:
- A - costs USD 0.95
- B - costs USD 1.26
- C - costs USD 2.33

*Business rules:*
- The machine accepts coins of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents.
- It allows the user to choose from 3 different products by entering coins (Ex: 20 20 10 1 5) and selecting a product (Ex: A, B, C)
- Then the machine gives out the change in the least possible amount of coins. (Ex: 50 50 20 5 2 1)
- The program should receive CLI input or use endpoints. Whichever you prefer.

*Constraints but you can add these if you want to make the task more interesting*
- Unlimited amount of products
- Unlimited amount of coins
